- Useful if you're struggling to get promoted/recognized at work
- Talks about glue work, and highlights some biases around it
- Gives some tips on how to get promoted (do what the company wants, create a story that highlights the work you're doing, align with your manager, create a plan & follow up)
- Personal note: Interestingly some companies can lean too much to either following the defined promotion process (not recognizing glue work at all, and thus suffering) while others may recognize glue work too much (well-defined tasks do not get done)
